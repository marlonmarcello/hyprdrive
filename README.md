## Project Overview

Hyprdrive is a custom desktop shell environment being built for the Hyprland Wayland compositor.

**Primary Goal:** Develop a GNOME-like desktop shell with custom components (panel, control center, etc.) using Slint.

**Learning Goal:** Ultimately, this will serve as a hands-on project to learn Rust, dust off the old college knowledge on low level systems, and have fun.
